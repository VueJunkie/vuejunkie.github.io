Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>\\n<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>\\n<p><code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>\\n<p>Where <code>YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code>MONTH</code> and <code>DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code>MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter.
